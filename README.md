Project created is an Internet linked thermostat that can be accessed outside of the home using Wi-Fi.
Goal was to create a thermostat they can read room temperature indicate the result by an LED output, increasing or decreasing in the set temperature and simulate the data being sent to a server. I created code that initialize the timer interrupted the detect button presses, initialized the eye to see peripheral, initialized, the GPO, peripheral, and the UART peripheral. Attached is a report on the project and a diagram depicting the process.
